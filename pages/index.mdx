# Introduction
 
Welcome to the online resource for ISELP Programming.

This resource is an alternate format to the [ISELP Programming Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19JGCfusp80INEaoEr3Kflopd67AFguzkGtJh-I2Y7Lg/edit?usp=sharing), for educators to access when supporting students engaged in ISELP at their schools.

Each section provides two options for readers:

1. A *highlights and summary* section that reviews the basic level of information about that topic.
2. An *in-depth* section that goes into significantly more detail about that topic.

This resource is designed to be used by classroom teachers, ISSP teachers, administrators, SERTs, and anyone else involved in supporting students engaged in ISELP.
