# Portrait of a learner engaged in ISELP

*Note: While this section refers specifically to Giftedness, much of the information is applicable both to students who are identified as Exceptional Intellectual - Gifted, and to those students who are engaged in ISELP, but are receiving Non-Identified Special Education services.*

## Summary and Highlights

The Ministry of Education defines Giftedness as “[a]n unusually advanced degree of general intellectual ability that requires differentiated learning experiences of a depth and breadth beyond those normally provided in the regular school program to satisfy the level of educational potential indicated” (Ministry of Education, 2017). For the purposes of the Peel District School Board, this is the definition that is used to describe our Gifted learners.

It is important to note the other definitions of Giftedness that cite characteristics such as:

- “asynchronous development” (Vuyk, Kerr, & Thomas, 2016; Silverman, 1996);
- a “physiological reality” (Gifted Development Centre); and,
- exceptionally high ability regardless of academic performance (Peterson, 2015).

However, Giftedness goes far beyond this definition, and like all exceptionalities, is complex. Common characteristics and traits of Gifted learners are listed below:

### Affective qualities of Gifted learners

Gifted learners often perceive and engage with the world differently than their non-Gifted peers. While many of their ‘gifts’ present a multitude of opportunities, it is important to note that in some cases these ‘gifts’ might make students more vulnerable to academic anxiety, social-emotional problems, and Gifted underachievement (Stornelli, Flett, & Hewitt, 2009; Christopher & Shewmaker, 2010;. Gaesser, 2018).

### Gifted underachievement

Some Gifted students underperform compared to the evidence that they are capable of high achievement. Research offers a variety of reasons to explain Gifted underachievement including, but not limited to:

- students’ fixed mindset about giftedness such as perfectionism or rebellion;
- feeling unsupported by parents, teachers and/or non-Gifted peers; and,
- misperceptions about the value of student work such as varied interpretations of depth and breadth of learning (Rimm, 1986; Roberts, Inman & Robins, 2022).
