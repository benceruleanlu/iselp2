# Portrait of a learner engaged in ISELP

_Note: While this section refers specifically to Giftedness, much of the information is applicable both to students who are identified as Exceptional Intellectual - Gifted, and to those students who are engaged in ISELP, but are receiving Non-Identified Special Education services._

## Summary and Highlights

The Ministry of Education defines Giftedness as “[a]n unusually advanced degree of general intellectual ability that requires differentiated learning experiences of a depth and breadth beyond those normally provided in the regular school program to satisfy the level of educational potential indicated” (Ministry of Education, 2017). For the purposes of the Peel District School Board, this is the definition that is used to describe our Gifted learners.

It is important to note the other definitions of Giftedness that cite characteristics such as:

- “asynchronous development” (Vuyk, Kerr, & Thomas, 2016; Silverman, 1996);
- a “physiological reality” (Gifted Development Centre); and,
- exceptionally high ability regardless of academic performance (Peterson, 2015).

However, Giftedness goes far beyond this definition, and like all exceptionalities, is complex. Common characteristics and traits of Gifted learners are listed below:

  display all of these characteristics.)

### Affective qualities of Gifted learners

Gifted learners often perceive and engage with the world differently than their non-Gifted peers. While many of their ‘gifts’ present a multitude of opportunities, it is important to note that in some cases these ‘gifts’ might make students more vulnerable to academic anxiety, social-emotional problems, and Gifted underachievement (Stornelli, Flett, & Hewitt, 2009; Christopher & Shewmaker, 2010;. Gaesser, 2018).

### Gifted underachievement

Some Gifted students underperform compared to the evidence that they are capable of high achievement. Research offers a variety of reasons to explain Gifted underachievement including, but not limited to:

- students’ fixed mindset about giftedness such as perfectionism or rebellion;
- feeling unsupported by parents, teachers and/or non-Gifted peers; and,
- misperceptions about the value of student work such as varied interpretations of depth and breadth of learning (Rimm, 1986; Roberts, Inman & Robins, 2022).

## In-Depth

### What is Giftedness?

Giftedness is a complex exceptionality. As such, there are a variety of definitions that are used to describe “Giftedness” across a variety of resources. There is no universally accepted definition of _gifted_. Some definitions are functional and relate to a selection process (e.g., scores, percentiles) and some clarify the nature of giftedness (e.g., domains, affinities). The Ministry of Education’s definition of Giftedness is: “an unusually advanced degree of general intellectual ability that requires differentiated learning experiences of a depth and breadth beyond those normally provided.” This is the definition under which the Peel District School Board and schools throughout the province use to determine “Giftedness.”

However, it is important to note the other definitions of Giftedness that cite characteristics such as:

- “asynchronous development” (Vuyk, Kerr, & Thomas, 2016; Silverman, 1996);
- a “physiological reality” (Gifted Development Centre); and,
- exceptionally high ability regardless of academic performance (Peterson, 2015).

Vuky, Kerr, & Thomas (2016) present a definition of Giftedness that incorporates a wide swath of the research into Giftedness, defining it as “asynchronous development in which advanced cognitive abilities and heightened intensity combine to create inner experiences and awareness that are qualitatively different from the norm” (Vuyk, Kerr, & Thomas, 2016, pg. 60). Most importantly, though, as there are no two Gifted learners who are exactly alike, there is no single definition of Giftedness (Kennedy & Farley, 2017).

### Common characteristics of Gifted learners

There is a common misconception that Gifted students are a fairly heterogeneous group (Schultz, 2018); however, Gifted students can exhibit a wide range of personality characteristics and processing abilities.

The graphic below outlines those characteristics that appear most commonly in Gifted students, even though they will be expressed differently in each student. It is important to recognize that not every Gifted student will necessarily show all of the same characteristics or common traits.

### Misconceptions about Giftedness

Due to the complex intellectual and socio-emotional traits of Gifted learners, it is not uncommon for educators to misunderstand their behaviours, attitudes, and learning needs or desires. As educators, it is important to understand these misconceptions and to understand the truths as they have direct implications on teaching practice and the ways in which Gifted students learn.

Researchers acknowledge a number of misconceptions about Gifted students that are identified in the chart below, along with considerations for teaching practice.

| **_"Additional tasks and rote learning are appropriate means of enrichments"_** (Schultz, 2018; Gomez-Arizaga et al, 2020).                                                                                                                          | Additional work will often be received as punitive as opposed to an opportunity and will often result in resentment of the identification (Gomez-Arizaga, et al., 2020).                                                                           | Consider offering class tasks that have a “low floor and high ceiling” (e.g. an activity that all students can easily begin, based on their own understanding of the material, and that can be worked on according to each student’s level of engagement and desire to go deeper). <br /><br /> Draw on students' interests to engage them in learning as opposed to giving "extra questions" or additional rote tasks. |
| **_"Gifted learners will be academically successful, regardless of their learning experiences, and therefore do not need services by their school"_** (Gomez-Arizaga, Valdivia-Lefort, Castillo-Hermosilla, Hébert, & Leonor Conejeros-Solar, 2020). | Gifted students engage with the world differently than their non-Gifted peers. <br /><br /> Absence of challenge can translate into lack of motivation, frustration, and even disengagement in the regular classroom (Gomez-Arizaga, et al., 2020) | Teachers should be aware that Gifted students may need supports that attend to affective aspects of education.

### Affective qualities of Gifted learners

Gifted learners often perceive and engage with the world differently than their non-Gifted peers. While many of their ‘gifts’ present a multitude of opportunities, it is important to note that in some cases these ‘gifts’ might make students more vulnerable to academic anxiety, social-emotional problems, and Gifted underachievement (Stornelli, Flett, & Hewitt, 2009; Christopher & Shewmaker, 2010;. Gaesser, 2018). However, with informed adults who understand their unique needs, Gifted students can flourish.

Researchers have investigated anxiety as it specifically pertains to Gifted learners and identified five ways it can be exhibited by some Gifted learners:

1. asynchronistic development;
2. multipotentiality;
3. self concept;
4. perfectionism; and,
5. overexcitabilities.

Each of these _affective areas_ will be discussed further in the following sections.

### Gifted Underachievement

Some Gifted students underperform compared to the evidence that they are capable of high achievement. Research offers a variety of reasons to explain Gifted underachievement including, but not limited to: students’ fixed mindset about giftedness such as perfectionism, rebellion; feeling unsupported by parents, teachers and/or non-Gifted peers; and misperceptions about the value of student work such as varied interpretations of depth and breadth of learning (Rimm, 1986; Roberts, Inman & Robins, 2022).

The [Achievement Orientation Model](https://gifted.uconn.edu/aom/) (Siegle, McCoach & Roberts, 2017) suggests an interrelationship between gifted motivation and achievement. Essentially, Gifted students will self-regulate their learning behaviour and achieve when they believe they have the confidence to perform a task (self-efficacy); when they believe a task has value and is meaningful; and when they believe that their learning environment is built upon supportive relationships with educators.

</span>

Teachers can shape learning to be more engaging and meaningful for Gifted students when there is mutual engagement in - and knowledge of - the learner's portrait. In-depth discussions with students to co-construct learning tasks and methods of inquiry establishes joint trust and shared responsibility toward the student’s achievement outcomes.
