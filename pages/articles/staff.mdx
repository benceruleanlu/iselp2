# The Role School-Based Support Staff in ISELP

The majority of ISELP implementation should take place in the student’s regular classroom. However, the development of the initial ISELP program, the regular review of the program, and updates to the program (as needed), are usually coordinated by the ISSP teacher. Key aspects of the ISSP teacher’s role as it relates to supporting the student engaged in ISELP include the following:

-   Regularly support and collaborate with the classroom teacher to effectively develop ISELP programming
-   Providing strategies for teachers who have students engaged in ISELP in their classes, including consulting around programming opportunities
-   Supporting teachers in understanding the complete learner portrait of the student engaged in ISELP
-   Coordinating with classroom teachers to ensure appropriate accommodations are working and are meeting the needs of the student
-   Being involved in development of transition plans and assisting students to execute plans
-   Supporting classroom teachers in developing, reviewing, and updating IEPs 
-   Providing more information about Special Education programming to families/caregivers, as needed
-   Accessing additional supports and resources (e.g., SERT, PSSP, Itinerants, community-based, etc.), as needed
-   Coordinating supports and additional interventions to support student engaged in ISELP

The primary role of the classroom teacher is to assist students engaged in ISELP to develop their intellectual and academic potential in collaboration with the student, parent/caregiver, and the ISSP teacher. This development is framed through the Gifted/Enhanced Learning Plan in the student’s IEP. Teaching a Gifted child comes with excitement and challenges. Educators must have the skills to differentiate their instruction to help students across the achievement spectrum grow to their full learning potential. The ISSP teacher can assist the classroom teacher to provide the appropriate accommodations and learning experiences that will support the student’s learning needs. The interplay between the student, classroom teacher and ISSP teacher is integral to offering the most effective learning environment for the learner who is part of ISELP.

The graphic below highlights the roles and responsibilities of the ISSP teacher, student, family, and classroom teacher and how they are each inter-connected in the ISELP program at a school.

As the learner engaged in ISELP will often learn faster, and can form an elaborate and differentiated knowledge of a topic, more so than the learner who does not require the support of ISELP programming, there are some specific strategies and tips for the ISSP teacher to consider in order to provide adequate and useful support. This section offers tips and consideration for monitoring the progress of the learner engaged in ISELP and for supporting teachers in offering effective programming.

## Summary and Highlights

Monitoring the progress of the learner engaged in ISELP is necessary to provide the appropriate academic and socio-emotional support to ensure success.

### Supporting program extensions and differentiation:

To adequately support program extensions or differentiation, it is imperative that the ISSP teacher emphasize with classroom teachers that:

1.  Extensive/Alternative work should **not **be in addition to the standard work.
2.  Evaluation of work produced in this manner should be assessed based on the standard, grade-level appropriate curricular expectations.

Providing learners engaged in ISELP with additional work and grading "harder" on an alternative set of expectations is punitive (e.g., extra-workload, stricter expectations in terms of grades) and it is likely that the student will build a reluctance to attempt such work.

Supporting classroom teachers with effective programming strategies can be one of the more delicate matters that an ISSP teacher will deal with in order to support a student who is engaged in ISELP. The ISSP teacher's ultimate goal will be to act as an advocate for the learner's needs while working with the student to develop their ability to self-advocate with classroom teachers.

### Mental health and well-being:

Gifted learners will frequently develop in an asynchronous manner. For example, cognitively they can be quite mature relative to their peer group (e.g. greater ability for abstract reasoning, eloquent use of language, etc.) but socially can be immature and unsure as to how to relate to their peers. This can lead to anxieties and feelings of not belonging. It is important for the ISSP and/or Guidance teacher to keep apprised of their feelings in this regard.

Additional supports for the learner engaged in ISELP can be accessed through PSSP staff, as required, through the Student Review Process.

### Goal setting and transitions:

As students approach middle school and secondary education, it's crucial for them to consider their educational pathways. 

School teams should communicate the choices and associated timelines to families/caregivers and students to aid in goal setting and planning, to provide for the necessary time for the student to consider options and make an effective decision that supports their goals.

It's also important to recognize that Gifted learners often face challenges in this decision-making due to their diverse interests, talents, and family expectations. Goal setting becomes a key component in gathering student input for their Individual Education Plan (IEP) annually. These students, often high achievers with extensive extracurricular involvement, need guidance to evaluate educational programs that align with their interests and learning profile, while also exploring additional opportunities without overextending themselves.

## In-Depth

### Supporting program extensions and differentiation

Accommodations for learners engaged in ISELP provide the opportunity to explore concepts/assignments/tasks in greater depth and breadth. As such, the role of the ISSP teacher may be to advocate for this accommodation to "open" tasks and learning opportunities as opposed to assigning the learner additional work. To adequately support program extensions or differentiation, it is imperative that the ISSP teacher emphasize with classroom teachers that:

1.  Extensive/Alternative work should **not** be in addition to the standard work.
2.  Evaluation of work produced in this manner should be assessed based on the standard, grade-level appropriate curricular expectations.

Providing learners engaged in ISELP with additional work and grading "harder" on an alternative set of expectations is punitive (e.g., extra-workload, stricter expectations in terms of grades) and it is likely that the student will build a reluctance to attempt such work. Instead, ideas for enhancement could include allowing a multimedia presentation of work originally assigned as an essay, having the student study an area of interest in depth while classmates are learning a general overview of a subject, have the the student create a learning game to try with other students or other work that is derived from the student's learner portrait and IEP goals.

Facilitating conversations with classroom teachers on programming can be one of the more delicate matters that an ISSP teacher will deal with in order to support a student who is engaged in ISELP. The ISSP teacher's ultimate goal will be to act as an advocate for the learner's needs while working with the student to develop their ability to self-advocate with classroom teachers. If successful, their experience as a student can be greatly empowered.

### Withdrawal supports (as needed)

**Working with Like-Minded Peers**

While the majority of the programming offered to students participating in ISELP should occur as part of the regular teaching and learning activities in the student's main classroom, there will be times when the student will benefit from opportunities to work outside of the classroom on individual or small group tasks, tailored to the goals in their Gifted/Enhanced Learning Plan.

The following are examples of withdrawal opportunities that can benefit students participating in ISELP as a compliment to the programming provided in their regular classroom:

-   *Seminars/special projects* - Projects may include interdisciplinary studies or projects focused on the individual/group interests of the students involved.
-   *Cluster grouping* - Students work in small groups on tasks or skills tailored to their Gifted Plan/Enhanced Learning Plan alternative goals and expectations.
-   *Mentorships* - Students work with a student in a younger grade or a same-grade peer, serving as a mentor to that student, focused on areas of shared interest. Alternatively, the student works with a resource teacher, parent volunteer, or community expert to develop skills in a specific field. Mentoring relationships are a natural and supportive opportunity for both the mentor and mentee to enhance the student's social-emotional learning skills.
-   *Online collaboration* - Students can access virtual learning environments set up to connect students in a family of schools, providing remote opportunities to collaborate, connect with peers who share similar interests, or network with like-minded peers.
-   *Leadership in areas of interest* - Facilitating/creating clubs, school ambassador, academic/extracurricular contests, community involvement (e.g., contributing to a local retirement home/legion/community centre, etc.)

Most importantly, the work that students complete as part of a withdrawal opportunity should not be in addition to the work assigned as part of their regular classroom learning. These opportunities should be complementary to the regular work, and offered as an alternative task to what is assigned in the classroom during their withdrawal time.

When a student is provided with opportunities for withdrawal as part of their ISELP programming, staff should ensure that the work completed as part of this withdrawal is focused and tailored toward the alternative goals and expectations, as outlined in the student's IEP.

### Opportunities for Acceleration

Acceleration, which means to work through curricular topics at a greater pace than is usually expected, is another strategy to accommodate for the learning needs of Gifted students. 

Teachers working with students engaged in ISELP can recommend variations of acceleration through asynchronous learning opportunities. The examples below provide suggestions for ways that ISELP students can explore accelerated learning opportunities while simultaneously working through the standard curricular work:

-   Preparing for science, computing, arts, business, and other subject-based contests (an extensive list of contests available to students can be found here: [https://www.youthofcanada.ca/contests](https://www.youthofcanada.ca/contests))
-   Preparing for advanced mathematics-based contests ([Canadian Mathematical Gray Jay Competition](https://cms.math.ca/competitions/canadian-mathematical-gray-jay-competition-cmgc/), [Canadian Open Mathematics Challenge](https://www2.cms.math.ca/Competitions/COMC/2021/#main), [Canadian Math Kangaroo Contest](https://mathkangaroo.ca/), [Caribou Mathematics Competition](https://cariboutests.com/), [Gauss Mathematics Contests](https://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/gauss.html)) 
-   Enrol within advanced learning extra-curricular organizations (e.g. Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth, University of Waterloo Engineering Science Quest, Brain Power, The Knowledge Society, etc.)

The link below discusses the benefits of acceleration for Gifted learners:

### Mental Health (Asynchronous Development)

Gifted learners will frequently develop in an asynchronous manner. For example, cognitively they can be quite mature relative to their peer group (e.g. greater ability for abstract reasoning, eloquent use of language, etc.) but socially can be immature and unsure as to how to relate to their peers. This can lead to anxieties and feelings of not belonging. It is important for the ISSP and/or Guidance teacher to keep apprised of their feelings in this regard.

As with any child, a Gifted learner may not immediately open up to the support teachers about such issues. A good starting point for discussions will lean more toward their academic needs. If the learner senses that the ISSP/Guidance teacher is an effective support for them, they may begin to relay their perceptions and thus allow you to work with them in closing such gaps.

For further information on asynchronous development and the Gifted learner, see the link below. [Asynchronous Development | National Association for Gifted Children](http://dev.nagc.org/resources-publications/resources-parents/social-emotional-issues/asynchronous-development)

#### Accessing support from PSSP staff

As with any student requiring the support of PSSP staff, Gifted students can be brough to a Student Review Meeting to discuss interventions and supports that can be provided by board PSSP staff (e.g., Psychologists, Social Workers). Below is an outline of the services available from PSSP staff:

**Social Work**

School social workers assist schools in identifying and helping to address and remove those obstacles for children and within their environment, including systemic racism and oppression, which interfere with their ability to benefit from educational experiences. Currently, the most frequently requested types of social work service are:

-   goal-focused, time-limited counselling with students and families
-   consultations with school personnel including SRM Level 2
-   crisis intervention
-   facilitation of referrals to community agencies/resources

The five domains of Social Work Service are:

-   personal adjustment
-   family adjustment
-   attendance and absenteeism
-   mental health
-   crisis

**Psychology Consultants**:

Psychoeducational Consultants provide a variety of psychological services to schools. Currently, the most frequently requested types of service from the Psychology Department are:

-   psychoeducational assessment
-   consultation, including behavioural
-   support pertaining to SEA documentation
-   counselling individual students/parents on a short-term basis
-   providing PD for schools, teachers, BEAs and parent groups
-   facilitating requests for risk assessments
-   providing intensive case management

Psychoeducational Consultants may facilitate a variety of group counselling programs (e.g., to address such issues as self-regulation, grief, parental separation/divorce, anger management, social skills, etc.) and can also provide support through individual counselling and crisis management support.

#### Check-Ins

It can be beneficial to establish a centralized locationto receive accommodations, support, a place to work or de-escalate if needed (e.g., the ISSP office, a resource room, etc.). SEA devices that are accessed by students engaged in ISELP can be kept here, along with other tools to support student accommodations.

As with any student in need of support, Gifted learners may seek your assistance in an irregular and/or unconventional manner. Having a consistent physical space for them to find you can be critical for the support relationship to develop, creating an "open-door" effect. Regular check-ins support building a positive rapport with the students that support staff are working with.

### Building Self-Advocacy Skills

To effectively support a student engaged in ISELP, it is imperative to support the learner in building advocacy skills. This will ultimately allow the learner to speak to their needs and strengths and to have a solid understanding of their learner portrait and greater cognitive abilities. By speaking for themselves and understanding their own learner portrait, students will more efficiently receive the necessary resources and/or support they need from their classroom teachers as well as take agency in their learning. Modelling problem solving is one way the ISSP teacher can initiate self-advocacy skills. Self-advocacy for the learner engaged in ISELP is also an outlet for expressing positive and creative energy, and a passion for innovation and justice that many Gifted students possess. For example, encouraging the learner to write a proposal to their teacher or prepare a presentation on a school issue will serve them well beyond school. When supporting students to learn how to self-advocate in respectful and responsible ways, the ISSP teacher will help the learner “own” their Giftedness and authentically hone their skills.

#### 4 Tips to Support the Gifted Student with Self-Advocacy:

-   Pick the right time
-   Understand your audience (i.e., when advocating with a teacher, administrator, family/caregiver)
-   Identify the issue/problem while recognizing others' perspectives
-   Keep an open mind and be realistic

### SRMs and Case Conferences

For many students, the results of the grade 4 screening tool is the first time that they will be referred to a Level 2 Student Review Meeting (SRM) to discuss possible programming and services, while others may have been referred before for exceptional needs for extensive academic work, social-emotional issues, or both.

Whenever the student is initially brought to a Level 1 SRM or a Level 2 SRM through the [Student Review Process](https://sites.google.com/pdsb.net/student-review-process-srp-oct/home), this is the beginning of an ongoing and more collaborative look into the student portrait. However, In cases where the student has additional needs, it may be beneficial for the champion (e.g., the classroom teacher, ISSP and/or Guidance teacher, etc.) to organize a Level 1 Student Review Meeting (SRM) or case conference with classroom teachers, support staff, the student, and family/caregivers to ensure - early on in the school year - the best possible ways for the student to experience challenge and achieve success.

Case conferences can be completed either formally or informally depending upon the individual needs of the student. During case conferences, important information about the student can be shared, suggested accommodations can be made, purposeful resources can be explored, and questions can be answered.

**Partnership between the student, family/caregivers, classroom teacher, and ISSP and Guidance teachers are key to ensuring that the learner's extensive learning needs are met.**

### Goal setting, planning, and transitions

As students approach middle school and secondary education, it's crucial for them to consider their educational pathways, including Regional Learning Choices Programs (like Sci-Tech, French Immersion, Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate), Secondary Enhanced Learning Program, or their home school. 

School teams should communicate the choices and associated timelines to families/caregivers and students to aid in goal setting and planning. For instance, entry into Regional Programs typically occurs in grade 6 or 9 via an application and lottery system, except for the Arts Program which starts in grade 7. On the other hand, placement in Enhanced Learning Classes or Secondary Enhanced Learning Programs follows the IPRC process.

It's also important to recognize that Gifted learners often face challenges in this decision-making due to their diverse interests, talents, and family expectations. Goal setting becomes a key component in gathering student input for their Individual Education Plan (IEP) annually. These students, often high achievers with extensive extracurricular involvement, need guidance to evaluate educational programs that align with their interests and learning profile, while also exploring additional opportunities without overextending themselves.

Therefore, early and ongoing planning support is recommended, ensuring students fully understand their options and can identify the programs that best align with their interests and developmental needs.
