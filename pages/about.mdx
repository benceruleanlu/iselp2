# About

The idea behind this website was to provide a more digestable way to intake the information from the rather lengthly [ISELP Programming Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19JGCfusp80INEaoEr3Kflopd67AFguzkGtJh-I2Y7Lg/edit?usp=sharing) document.

This project is meant to succeed the original [ISELP for Everyone](https://github.com/benceruleanlu/iselp).

This project uses the [Nextra](https://nextra.site/) plug-in for Next.js, with an MIT license under Shu Ding.
